Dataset for MetaSLAM Challenge. The website: [https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/metaslam](https://sites.google.com/andrew.cmu.edu/metaslam)

# Datasets
We provide four (more in the future) datasets for evaluating place recognition or global localization methods. They are
- **CMU Day/Night UGV**: 
- **CMU Helicopter Terrain**:
- **CMU UAV Localization**:
- **Pittsburgh Large Scale**: It has LiDAR point clouds and ground truth poses for 55 trajectories. Each trajectory is divided into several submaps, and a submap has size 50m*50m with the distance between every two submaps being 2m. [Download](https://xxxx).

(Maybe we can put a summary table here~)

Datasets are provided in the [`kapture format`](https://github.com/naver/kapture). You can easily manage the data with the tools. For more information about dataset, please refer to [dataset description](./docs/dataset_description.md).


# Software
Tools, such as data loader and evaluation metrics, are also provided in Python.
